# Aaron Widjaja â€” GitHub Pages Portfolio

This is a personalized, minimal portfolio built from your resume and Caltech Connection responses.

## How to publish
1. Create a GitHub repo named `yourusername.github.io`.
2. Upload all files/folders from this project (keep the `assets/` folder).
3. Replace `assets/resume.pdf` and `assets/cv.pdf` with your actual PDFs.
4. Replace `assets/headshot.jpg` with your real headshot (same filename).
5. Edit any text in `index.html` as needed. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io` shortly.

> Note: No LinkedIn link is included. You can add one later if desired.
